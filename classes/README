Open source Java implementation of the TextRank algorithm by Mihalcea,
et al. Note that this code only implements key phrase extraction based
on keyword co-occurance described in section 3 of the Mihalcea-Tarau
paper. This code does not yet implement the sentence extraction
described in section 4 of that paper.

NB: There is a known issue with use of JWNL (Java libraries for
WordNet) such that if the graph size exceeds a particular threshold,
then low-level Java I/O reads to the WordNet database on disk will
cause Java thread to block -- even though JVM tools show no blocked
threads.

A potential remedy is to dump WordNet, or at least the parts of it
used here, into some DBD structure with an in-memory cache.

simple test:
	ant run

test with a specific data file FOO.txt

	ant -Ddata.file=FOO.txt run

build the JAR for export to another project:
	ant jar
