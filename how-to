created new eclipse project : textrank-from-scratch
imported the folders one by one : src res test classes lib and whatever else was there
added all the jars in lib directory to build path (right click-->build path-->configure build path--> libraries-->add jars)
changed 4 lines in TextRank.java file instead of command line arguments gave hardcoded arguments
right click project--> run
